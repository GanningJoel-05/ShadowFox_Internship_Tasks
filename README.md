## 🟢 BEGINNER LEVEL PROJECTS:

**1) Enhanced Console-based Calculator:**
  🔹 A fully functional console-based calculator that performs:
       ✅ Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Modulo.
       ✅ Scientific operations: Square root, Power (Exponentiation), and Logarithm.
       ✅ Unit conversions:
           🔹 Temperature: Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit.
           🔹 Currency: INR ↔ USD (with a fixed rate).

🛠️ **Tech Stacks Used:**
   🔹 Core Java.
   🔹 Java `Math` class for scientific functions.
   🔹 Scanner for input handling.

💡 **Key Learnings:**
   🔹 Java syntax, method creation, and method overloading.
   🔹 Handling invalid inputs using try-catch.
   🔹 Menu-driven console applications with loops and conditionals.

**2) Simple Contact Management System:**
   🔹 This is a command-line Java application that allows users to:
      ✅ Add, view, update, and delete contacts.
      ✅ Contacts stored in an ArrayList for runtime management.

🛠️ **Tech Stacks Used:**
   🔹 Java, ArrayList, OOP Basics
   🔹 User interaction through the console.

💡 **Key Learnings:**
   🔹 Classes, Objects, and Encapsulation.
   🔹 Menu-based interaction.
   🔹 Basic data handling using collections.
   
## 🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL PROJECTS:

**1) Bank Management System (Console-based):**
   🔹 A simulation of a simple bank where users can:
       ✅ Account creation, balance check.
       ✅ Deposit and withdrawal.
       ✅ View transaction history with timestamps.

🛠️ **Tech Stacks Used:**
   🔹 Java OOP, ArrayList, Exception Handling.
   🔹 SQL Database.

💡 **Key Learnings:**
   🔹 Custom logic for banking transactions.
   🔹 Encapsulation, constructors, and class design.
   🔹 Real-world simulation of a banking system.

**2) Library Management System with SQLite:**
   🔹 A console-based library management system integrated with **SQLite** for data persistence. The features are,
       ✅ User registration and login (credentials stored in DB).
       ✅ Add, update, delete, and view books.
       ✅ Issue and return books with user-book mapping.
       ✅ Track borrowing history with timestamps.

🛠️ **Technologies Used:**
   🔹 Java + JDBC.
   🔹 SQLite as the database.
   🔹 CLI-based user interface.

💡 **Key Concepts Learned:**
   🔹 Database connection using JDBC.
   🔹 SQL query execution from Java.
   🔹 Data modeling with multiple tables (users, books, issued_books).

## 🔴 ADVANCED LEVEL PROJECT:

**1) Online Banking System (GUI + Backend):**
   🔹 A Swing-based desktop app that simulates online banking features:
       ✅ User registration and login system using GUI.
       ✅ Deposit and withdraw functionality.
       ✅ View balance and transaction history.
       ✅ Account security with validations.

🛠️ **Tech Stacks Used:**
   🔹 Java Swing, Core Java, File-based logic (extendable to JDBC)
   🔹 Core Java backend logic.

💡 **Key Learnings:**
   🔹 GUI development with Swing.
   🔹 MVC design approach.
   🔹 GUI event handling and exception management.

## 🙏 Acknowledgment:
   🔹 A heartfelt thank you to ShadowFox Technologies for organizing this amazing internship journey.
   🔹 These projects helped me grow from writing simple Java code to developing full-featured desktop applications.
